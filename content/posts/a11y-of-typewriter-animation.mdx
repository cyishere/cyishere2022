description: Improve web accessibility by making typewriter animations friendly to screen readers and how to achieve them using aria-label and accessible hiding.
excerpt: This piece covers the challenges of making dynamic animations accessible, particularly for screen readers. It walks through failed attempts at using aria-hidden before demonstrating how aria-label, while unconventional for headings, solved the accessibility issue.

There's a typewriter effect in the hero section of [the SkyPorch landing page](https://skyporch.co). After I added that JavaScript animation I'd always worried about it with the accessibility - how could screen readers would read it? The words are consistently changed. Finally, I refactored that part yesterday. Here's the process.

(I'm using the [silktide's chrome extension](https://silktide.com/tools/toolbar/) to test the accessibility.)

The code is written in React; here's the previous structure. I created a component for the typewriter content and its JavaScript animation.

```js
// omit other parts

const WORDS = ['ship', 'love', 'live'];

return (
  <h1>
    We <TypewriterEffect words={words} /> software
  </h1>
);

// omit the js animation
const TypewritterEffect = ({ words }) => {
  const typewritterRef = useRef(null);
  const cursorRef = useRef(null);
  // omit the js animations

  return (
    <>
      <em ref={typewriterRef} />
      <noscript>{words[0]}</noscript>
      {/* the cursor */}
      <span ref={cursorRef} className="no-js-hidden">
        _
      </span>
      {/*
				I used to put here a button to control 
				the animation pause or play.
				This is a highly simplified version of that.
			*/}
      <button>Pause the animation</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

In the JSX part, the `em` element, which contains the words, is empty by default. I use GSAP to put the words into it dynamically. There's a `noscript` tag for showing the content when JavaScript is disabled in the browser; the `no-js-hidden` class hides the cursor when JavaScript is disabled.

So with this code, the screen readers read the content as <em>"Heading 1 - we shi \_ Pause the animation software"</em>. (I knew the button there was a bad practice for semantic HTML; I needed to fix that, too.) The screen readers sometimes read the animation part as "love" or "live" because of the changing words.

## First Attempt and Failed

Added the `aria-hidden` attribute.

In the beginning, I thought I could add an `aria-hidden="true"` to that `em` element and the button and the cursor, also add the correct content and visually hide it. `aria-hidden="true"` makes the content inside that HTML element **not visible or announced to users of assistive technology such as screen readers**. Here's the code:

```jsx
// omit others
return (
  <>
    <em aria-hidden="true" ref={typewriterRef} />
    <span className="visually-hidden">{words.join(', ')}</span>
    <noscript>{words[0]}</noscript>
    {/* the cursor */}
    <span aria-hidden="true" ref={cursorRef} className="no-js-hidden">
      _
    </span>
    <button aria-hidden="true">Pause the animation</button>
  </>
);
```

> [!INFO] `visually-hidden` is a utility class that hides content visually, the same as the `sr-only` class in Bootstrap or TailwindCSS. This is called _accessible hiding_.
>
> My `visually-hidden` class:

```css
.visually-hidden {
  position: absolute;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  margin: -1px;
  padding: 0;
  border: 0;
}
```

But this doesn't work. And NONE OF IT works. The screen readers still read this as <em>"Heading 1 - we shi \_ Pause the animation software"</em>.

I assume that because of the animation, the component re-renders for every letter, and the `aria-hidden="true"` can't work. But how to fix it?

## Second Attempt and Failed

Added the `aria-hidden` attribute to the parent element.

Then I tried to add the `aria-hidden="true"` on their parent - the `h1` tag. Because this attribute can make the element and **all the elements inside it** invisible to the screen readers (assistive technologies). I removed all the Aria attributes in the `TypewriterEffect` component, and that visually hidden span made the change to the `h1`:

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <h1 aria-hidden="true">
      We <TypewriterEffect words={words} /> software
    </h1>
    <h1 className="visually-hidden">We {words.join(', ')} software.</h1>
  </>
);
```

This still doesn't work! The animation messes up everything.

## Third Attempt and Finally Succeed

Added `aria-label` attribute instead of `aria-hidden`.

After reading some articles, I finally found a way to solve it - instead of adding `aria-hidden`, I added `aria-label` to the `h1` element.

```jsx
return (
  <>
    <h1 aria-label={`We ${WORDS.join(', ')} software.`}>
      We <TypewriterEffect words={words} /> software
    </h1>
    {/* and I pull out that button */}
    <button aria-hidden="true">Pause the animation</button>
  </>
);
```

[The definition on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-description) is "The `aria-label` attribute defines a string value that labels an interactive element." The most common usage is when we use an svg icon for a button and to provide helpful information, such as with a button that only has a bird icon, provides a "link to Twitter account", etc. So, the screen readers wouldn't read the content inside that element but only read the content given to the `aria-label`.

```html
<button aria-label="link to Twitter account">
  <svg>...</svg>
</button>
```

It needs to be noted that, first, the `h1` heading isn't an "interactive element"; second, by using `aria-label`, all the text content inside that element will be replaced by the value of `aria-label`, so it should be used when only necessary.

And this is a "when only necessary" situation. We don't need to hide the content from the visual user by the need to hide it from screen readers because it's "unstable".

That's it. This is how I fix the accessibility issue of the typewriter animation.
