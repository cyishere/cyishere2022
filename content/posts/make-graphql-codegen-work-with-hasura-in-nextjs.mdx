As I used the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) before, I found out that making this Codegen work with [Hasura](https://hasura.io) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) needs some special configurations.

## Set Codegen Configurations for Hasura

The [Hasura's official tutorial](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/typescript-react-apollo/codegen/) provides a settings code block which I modified some "special configurations" in it (with the ⛑️ indicator):

```javascript
// ./codegen.js

// ⛑️ Change 1: import "dotenv"
require("dotenv").config();

// ⛑️ Change 2: Get Hasura's GraphQL API from environment variables
const API = process.env.HASURA_GRAPHQL_API;

module.exports = {
  schema: [
    {
      // ⛑️ Change 3: Use the `API` variable that just defined
      [API]: {
        headers: {
          // ⛑️ Change 4: Add content type
          "content-type": "application/json",
          // ⛑️ Change 5: Add admin secret from environment variables
          "x-hasura-admin-secret": process.env.HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
  documents: ["./src/**/*.tsx", "./src/**/*.ts"],
  overwrite: true,
  generates: {
    "./src/generated/graphql.tsx": {
      plugins: [
        "typescript",
        "typescript-operations",
        "typescript-react-apollo",
      ],
      config: {
        skipTypename: false,
        withHooks: true,
        withHOC: false,
        withComponent: false,
      },
    },
    "./graphql.schema.json": {
      plugins: ["introspection"],
    },
  },
};
```

**Explain about these changes**:

- Change 1: for this `codegen.js` file can get environment variables, we need to install [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and import it into this file.
- Change 2 & Change 3: these two are optional. I don't want to expose my Hasura GraphQL API, so I choose to store it as an environment variable. Whether add these is up to you.
- Change 4 & Change 5: interacting with Hasura GraphQL API needs some permissions which are specified in the request `headers`.

In the picture above, at default Hasura GraphQL API needs `content-type` and `x-hasura-admin-secret`. **This is why I make the "4" and "5" changes.** After setting the permissions in the database tables, we can interact with the API with `x-hasura-role` and `x-hasura-user-id`. More "permission" content could find in [their official tutorials](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/authorization/1-todos-table-permissions/).

## Special Attentions for Next.js

We usually put environment variables in the `.env.local` file for Next.js applications, but this `codegen.js` file CANNOT read `.env.local`, so we need to create a `.env` file in the root directory just for Codegen and put those essential variables in it. The Codegen will not work without this.

## Last Step

Don't forget to add a script in the `package.json` file for using Codgen:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "gen": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.js"
  }
}
```

## More Infos

This is a note from me about developing an application with Next.js and Hasura. The app is called [DDD App](https://ddd.cyishere.dev), and it is a tool for remembering German nouns. You can learn more about it [here](/blog/ddd-app-a-neat-tool-for-remembering-german-nouns).
