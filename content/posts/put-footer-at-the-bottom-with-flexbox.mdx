I thought I knew how to use Flexbox to put a footer at the bottom until I read [@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph)'s "[ModernCSS 01](https://moderncss.dev/keep-the-footer-at-the-bottom-flexbox-vs-grid/)". I used to wrap `<header>` and `<main>` in a `div` together along with a `<footer>` then add `justify-content: space-between;` on the body to make `<footer>` at the bottom. But Stephanie's solution is using `margin-top: auto;`! It's extremely inspiring.

To figure out this one trick I learned and discovered more things.

By the way, this is my solution, it's not bad, but it could be better.

- I've learned from Josh W Comeau's [CSS course](https://css-for-js.dev/) that flexbox is a completely different layout mode than "the normal one". And **margins don't collapse on flexbox**.
- For block level elements (with certain width size), the `auto` value of margin would take up all available space in the given direction (left/right). This is why we use `margin: 0 auto;` to center a block element.
- Because there's no margin collapse on flexbox, when apply an `margin-top: auto` to an flexbox element, the margin would horizontally take up that available space, just like the vertical effect on block elements. This is why there's a `margin-top: auto;` trick in Stephanie's solution.

In [this pen](https://codepen.io/cyishere/pen/xxdYGwo) I put in an `article` block with `margin-left: auto;` for compare.

I hope this article could help people know more about CSS flexbox.
