Yesterday people in the Discord of [CSS for JS Developers Course](https://css-for-js.dev) asked whether there's any solution to achieve a full-bleed image within a wrapper with a maximum width.

## My Solution

So I tried this out:

```html
<article>
  <p>...</p>
  <img class="full-bleed" src="" />
  <p>...</p>
  <p></p>
</article>

<style>
  article {
    max-width: 680px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
  }

  .full-bleed {
    max-width: 100vw;
  }
</style>
```

The entire code is in [this Codepen](https://codepen.io/cyishere/pen/RwMbPeX).

## Other "Trick"

Then [Josh](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) shared [this solution](https://css-tricks.com/full-bleed/) posted on _CSS-Tricks_. I think the solution is very COOL.

```css
.full-width {
  width: 100vw;
  position: relative;
  left: 50%;
  right: 50%;
  margin-left: -50vw;
  margin-right: -50vw;
}
```

This does not require any additional settings. In my case, I set the elements in the `article` to Flexbox layout, which may cause some unexpected problems.
