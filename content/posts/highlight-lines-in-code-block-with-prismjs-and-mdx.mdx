## The Needs

There are blogs, websites, and online documents that have their code block with some lines highlighted. As in the screenshot below.

I always want to implement this cool thing for my own blog which is made of Next.js and MDX. I use [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) for highlighting the syntax of the code block. However, I couldn't find a way to enable its [Line Highlight plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/line-highlight/).

## The Flawed Way

My old approach was calling Prism in `useEffect`:

```js {2,5-9}
// This is the blog post layout component
import Prism from "prismjs";

const BlogPost = (props) => {
	useEffect(() => {
		if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
			Prism.highlightAll()
		}
	}, []);

	return (
		// omitted
	)
}
```

This approach cannot implement line highlight (at least not that I am aware of).

## The Right Way

After a VERY LONG time of research, I finally discovered a solution: instead of using `prismjs` with `next-mdx-remote`, we can use [rehype-prism-plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-prism-plus) with `next-mdx-remote`.

As the `next-mdx-remote` [official document says](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#apis) when we serialize the MDX content, we can use `remarkPlugins` and `rehypePlugins`. `rehype-prism-plus` is one of the "rehypePlugins".

So with putting `rehypePrism` in that `rehypePlugins` array, we can use `rehypePrism` just like it should be and without any additional configurations. The code is something like this:

```jsx {2,17}
// This is the UPDATED blog post layout component
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize';
import rehypePrism from 'rehype-prism-plus';

const BlogPost = (props) => {
  // omitted
};

export const getStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const content = {
    // omitted, not really like this
  };

  const mdxSource = await serialize(content, {
    mdxOptions: {
      remarkPlugins: [],
      rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
    },
  });

  return {
    // omitted
  };
};
```

[Here](https://github.com/cyishere/cyishere2022/blob/main/pages/blog/%5Bslug%5D.tsx) is the whole code of this blog post page.

/>

With this setup, if we inspect the code block with the Chrome dev tool, we can see that line 2 and line 16 have an extra class `highlight-line` (as seen in the screenshot above). Make sure the stylesheet for code block has `highlight-inline` style defined.

```css
code[class*='language-'] .highlight-line {
  background-color: hsl(256deg 100% 96%);
  display: block;
}
```

I import this stylesheet in the `_app.tsx` file to make it use globally.
