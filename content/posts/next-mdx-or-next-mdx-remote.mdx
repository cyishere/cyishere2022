I recently refactored this blog using [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote). Previously, I used [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx). I'll explain the differences between these two methods and why I chose `next-mdx-remote` in the article.

## The Very Complex `@next/mdx` Way

With `@next/mdx`, the Next.js can read every MDX file as a page. The file structure looks like this:

```bash
- pages/
	- blog/
		- article-1.mdx
		- article-2.mdx
		- article-3.mdx
	index.tsx
	about.tsx
```

There is also no need to create a file like this `pages/blog/[slug].jsx` to dynamically display the articles. This seems very convenient. But the disadvantage is that the structure of each MDX file becomes very complex.

**First**, we must import the layout component that each article page requires and export a default component wrapped in this layout:

```markdown {3-7}
// article-1.mdx

import { PostLayout } from "@/components/Layout";

export default ({ children }) => (
<PostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</PostLayout>
);

// The main markdown content
This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block.
```

**Second**, if we require additional components in this file, we must manually import them. For example, if I created a `Figure` component to display images, I must import it into each post's MDX file:

```markdown {4}
// article-1.mdx

import { PostLayout } from "@/components/Layout";
import Figure from "@/component/Figure";

export default ({ children }) => (
<PostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</PostLayout>
);

This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block.

// Then use `Figure` in the main content

<Figure
  alt="slideshow screenshot"
  src="/img/blog/accessible-slideshow-with-react/slideshow-screenshot.png"
  width={900}
  height={600}
/>
```

**Finally**, we must create an object to serve as `frontmatter` and pass it to the default component:

```markdown {5-11,14}
// article-1.mdx

import { PostLayout } from "@/components/Layout";

export const meta = {
title: "@next/mdx Or next-mdx-remote",
description:
"When building a blog with MDX and Next.js, there are so many ways. In this article, I'll show you why I choose next-mdx-remote instead of @next/mdx.",
createdAt: "2022-06-26",
tags: ["mdx", "next.js"],
};

export default ({ children }) => (
<PostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</PostLayout>
);

// The main markdown content
This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block.
```

## The Clean `next-mdx-remote` Way

With `next-mdx-remote`, we can write an article in **normal** markdown syntax:

```markdown
// article-1.mdx

---

title: "@next/mdx Or next-mdx-remote"
description: "When building a blog with MDX and Next.js, there are so many ways. In this article, I'll show you why I choose next-mdx-remote instead of @next/mdx."
createdAt: "2022-06-26"
tags: ["mdx", "next.js"]

This is a text block.

## This Is a Heading

<Figure
  alt="slideshow screenshot"
  src="/img/blog/accessible-slideshow-with-react/slideshow-screenshot.png"
  width={900}
  height={600}
/>

This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block. This is a text block.
```

We place meta data between two `---`, use any component without importing it in each file, and do not need to import the page layout.

To generate pages for each article, we use the _Next.js way_.

```jsx {3,10}
// pages/blog/[slug].jsx

const PostPage = ({ mdxSource, meta }) => {};

export default PostPage;

/**
 * Get artciel date in `getStaticProps` function
 */
export function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // omitted

  return {
    props: {
      mdxSource, // The main content in each mdx file
      meta, // The frontmatter part
    },
  };
}
```

To use the custom components, we pass them to the `MDXRemote`'s `component` prop, which is from `next-mdx-remote`:

```jsx {7-14,20}
// pages/blog/[slug].jsx

import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';
import { PostLayout } from '@/components/Layout';

const PostPage = ({ mdxSource, meta }) => {
  const components = {
    a: ({ children, ...props }) => (
      <Link {...props} passHref>
        <a>{children}</a>
      </Link>
    ),
    Figure,
  };

  return (
    <PostLayout>
      <h1>{meta.title}</h1>
      // Show the article content
      <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} components={components} />
    </PostLayout>
  );
};

export default PostPage;

// omitted
```

[Here](https://github.com/cyishere/cyishere2022/blob/main/pages/blog/%5Bslug%5D.tsx) is the entire code.

## Conclusion

Article pages can be generated from MDX files or dynamic routes; they are all static pages that are generated at build time. However, as shown in the code above, the `next-mdx-remote` method keeps the files cleaner and allows you to use the `getStaticProps` function. I hope this article could help you in deciding which to use.
