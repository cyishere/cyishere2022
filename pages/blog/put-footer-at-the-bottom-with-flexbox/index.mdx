// import PostLayout from "@/components/PostLayout";
// import Figure from "@/components/Figure";
// import { ExternalLink } from "@/components/Link";

export const meta = {
  title: "Put Footer at The Bottom with CSS Flexbox",
  description: "css flexbox, footer at bottom, css flex",
  createdAt: "2021-08-02",
  tags: ["css"],
};

export default ({ children }) => <div meta={meta}>{children}</div>;

To figure out this one trick I learned and discovered more things.

By the way, this is my solution, it's not bad, but it could be better.
