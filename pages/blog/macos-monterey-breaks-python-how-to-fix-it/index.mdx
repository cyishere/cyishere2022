After I updated my MacOS to Monterey, every time I changed the directory in the terminal this message below popped up:

```bash
env: python: No such file or directory
```

But I've already installed Python3. I googled out that Monterey removed Python2.7, but it cannot automatically point to Python3...

It took me 2 hours to find the solution, here they are:

## Step 1: Make Sure Python3 Is Installed

Use `whereis python3` to make sure it is installed. At this time, it would show something like this:

```bash
python3: /usr/bin/python3
```

## Step 2: Find Out the Brew Info

When installing Python3 with Home-brew, it also creates a `libexec` folder with unversioned symlinks, which can be found by this command: `brew info python`.

After executing this command, there will be something like the below print out:

```bash
python@3.9: stable 3.9.7
Interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language
https://www.python.org/
/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.7 (2,882 files, 49.3MB)
  Poured from bottle on 2021-09-15 at 22:09:14
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/python@3.9.rb
License: Python-2.0
==> Dependencies
Build: pkg-config ✔
Required: gdbm ✔, mpdecimal ✔, openssl@1.1 ✔, readline ✔, sqlite ✔, xz ✔
==> Caveats
Python has been installed as
  /usr/local/bin/python3

Unversioned symlinks `python`, `python-config`, `pip` etc. pointing to
`python3`, `python3-config`, `pip3` etc., respectively, have been installed into
  /usr/local/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin
```

I omit the rest of the print-out because the MOST IMPORTANT part of this is the _last line_.

## Step 3: Update Your $PATH

Put the directory path in that last line to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`, depending on which one of them you're using. The complete syntax is:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.9/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```

Save the file and update the shell environment:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile

# OR

source ~/.zshrc
```

Voilà! The `env: python: No such file or directory` problem is solved!

Now type `whereis python3` again, the result would be something like this: `python3: /usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/share/man/man1/python3.1`.

Your situation may be different from mine, so for more references, I put some links here and hope these would help you.
