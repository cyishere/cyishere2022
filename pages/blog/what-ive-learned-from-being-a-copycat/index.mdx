Because I didn't consider the complexity of the desktop version when I started structuring the DOM. That means I'll have to create a completely new DOM structure for a larger screen rather than relying on CSS to do the fancy responsive work. So after spending a significant amount of time refactoring my code, I ended up using three `<header>`s and letting the media query in CSS decide which one would be displayed which other two would be `display: none;`. I think it's a little messy.

The lesson I've learned here is **although starting with mobile-first, I need to think in the big picture, consider all the variants rather than "abandoning" the version for larger screens at first.**

## Plan first and document well

I tried to implement the concept of re-usable components in this project as much as possible. During coding, I assigned multiple tasks to one component, such as there's a `<TwoColumns />` component displayed as grid, because I wanted it to be used in every situation, I put several props on it. Then I forgot what they were and when I was supposed to use which...ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The lesson I've learned here is similar to the first one which **I need to plan ahead of time, consider all of the possibilities, and write document for them.**

There are several tools for writing documents for React projects; however, because this project is small, I decided to convert it to TypeScript in order to use types to specify variant props. (I could use `prop-types`, but I like TypeScript more and want to use it as much as possible. üòÑ)
