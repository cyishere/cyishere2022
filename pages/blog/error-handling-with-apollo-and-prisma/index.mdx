I think error handling is a very tricky part of development. When I started as a self-taught Node.js full-stack developer, I know use `throw new Error` would throw out the errors in the terminal, but I don't know how to let my frontend "know" these errors and show them in the UI for users. I really struggled with this for a while.

In this article, I'll showcase how to handle errors with Apollo Server & Prisma, then show the error messages in the frontend with Apollo Client & React. Thus, the users could know what is happening thereby adjust their inputs.

I'll make a register form as demonstration.

The main part we concern is the register mutation in the `resolvers.js` file, take a look at it:
