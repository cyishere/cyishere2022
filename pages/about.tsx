        <p>
          The first time I encountered ‚Äúweb development‚Äù was about 15 years ago
          when I changed my blogpost blog‚Äôs background color with CSS, that‚Äôs
          amazed me a lot!{' '}
          <strong>
            I thought it was very cool, the internet is the future!
          </strong>{' '}
          Around that time, I just graduated from college, and despite studying
          finance I decided to change my career to web development. So I started
          to learn programming by myself, reading books, articles, and
          discussions online.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got my first development job in 2007. From 2007 to 2012, I was a
          frontend developer and UX designer, most of my work was writing CSS
          hacks for IE6, and playing around with jQuery. Made a lot of templates
          for WordPress and e-commerce websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later I switched my career path and started a production company with
          my friends. I was a screenplay writer for the last four years (
          <strong>also self-taught</strong>). But I still love web development a
          lot. Developers work on code and take films as entertainment, I worked
          on films and take programming as entertainment. When I didn‚Äôt study
          films, I read articles about web development and followed along with
          the tutorials on{' '}

          I had spent two years, from 2020 to 2022, catching up on the new tech
          stacks, then because of{' '}

          as a frontend engineer for almost two years.

        <p>Now, I&apos;m a fan of React, GraphQL, and Prisma.</p>
